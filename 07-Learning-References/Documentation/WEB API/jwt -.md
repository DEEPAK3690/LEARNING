jwt -
authentication is usernaem and password 

authorization is will decide this user has access to this section 

json web token

used between in web apis to claim the data or access info from the server

uses HTTP stateless - so server requires all the info about the client to  process the data

it is a self contained token

it is encoded in strin g format 

this token is used to authenticate and authorize the users 

problem without jwt token , the server needs to remember and the store the session data ,not scalable
